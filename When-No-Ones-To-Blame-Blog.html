    <!-- Main Content -->
    <div class="container">
        <p>Nobody woke up this morning plotting to pay you less.</p>

        <p>Your boss isn't rubbing their hands together going "muahahaha, I'll describe her work as 'supportive' so I can lowball her salary!"</p>

        <p>The HR person who wrote your job description? They probably copied it from last year's template. Your manager who wrote "she's very collaborative" in your performance review? They're repeating language they've heard their whole career.</p>

        <p>Nobody's the villain here.</p>

        <p><strong>But here's the thing: when money that should be in your pocket ends up somewhere else, that's theft. Even if nobody meant it.</strong></p>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h2>The Bank Analogy</h2>

        <p>Imagine your bank has been short-changing your account $100 every week for 10 years because of an old glitch in their system.</p>

        <p>You've lost $52,000.</p>

        <p>Nobody at the bank programmed the glitch on purpose. Nobody's sitting there manually moving your money. It's just... how the old system runs. A legacy issue. "That's just how it's always worked."</p>

        <p>But the money is still gone.</p>

        <p>You still got robbed.</p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            It doesn't matter that nobody meant it.<br>
            It doesn't matter that "it's just how the system works."<br>
            Your money is still missing.
        </div>

        <p><strong>That's what's happening with women's wages.</strong></p>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h2>How the System Runs</h2>

        <p>Job descriptions use certain words—"support," "assist," "coordinate"—and those words trigger lower pay bands in the system.</p>

        <p>Other words—"lead," "execute," "manage"—trigger higher pay bands.</p>

        <p>Nobody decided this should happen. It's not written in a manual somewhere that says "use feminine language to justify lower pay." It's just... how the system evolved. How language patterns got embedded in HR practices decades ago. How pay bands got structured around certain job titles.</p>

        <p>Lower-paid language has been used to describe the work that we typically associate with "women's work" since before day dot.</p>

        <p>But that doesn't make it right, and that doesn't mean it has to stay that way.</p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <h4>Here's What This Looks Like:</h4>
            <p><strong>The company budgets $100K for a role.</strong></p>
            <p>You get offered $85K because your job title is "Program Coordinator."</p>
            <p>He gets offered $100K because his job title is "Program Manager."</p>
            <p>You're doing the same work. But the system allocated you to a lower pay band based on the title.</p>
            <p><strong>The company pockets the $15K difference.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>Or:</p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <h4>The Performance Review Pattern:</h4>
            <p>The system budgets $120K for "strategic leadership roles" and $90K for "support coordination roles."</p>
            <p>Your review says you're "helpful" and "collaborative"—supportive language. You stay in the $90K band.</p>
            <p>His review says he's "strategic" and "drives results"—leadership language. He moves into the $120K band.</p>
            <p>Same performance. Different language. <strong>The company keeps the $30K difference.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>Is this deliberate? No. Nobody sat in a meeting and said "let's create a language-based wealth extraction system."</p>

        <p>But it's <em>inherited</em>. And it keeps running. And the money keeps disappearing from women's paychecks into corporate bottom lines.</p>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h2>Where Does $52 Billion Go?</h2>

        <p>Every year, Australian women collectively lose $52 billion in wages.</p>

        <p>That's $1 billion every week. $143 million every day.</p>

        <p><strong>Where does it go?</strong></p>

        <p>Not to "men" as a group. It goes to <strong>corporate profits and organizational budgets.</strong></p>

        <p>When you're hired at $85K instead of $100K for the same role, that $15K doesn't go to your male colleague. It stays in the company's salary budget as unspent funds.</p>

        <p>What happens to those unspent funds?</p>

        <p>Sometimes they become profit. Sometimes they get redistributed—often as bonuses that disproportionately go to people in "leadership track" roles (who tend to be men because of the same language patterns). Sometimes they fund other parts of the business.</p>

        <p>But the primary theft is simple: <strong>money that should be your salary stays with the organization instead.</strong></p>

        <div class="emphasis-box">
            <strong>The inherited system operates like this:</strong><br><br>
            • Job descriptions use minimizing language for certain roles<br>
            • Those roles get slotted into lower pay bands<br>
            • Women disproportionately end up in those roles<br>
            • The salary difference stays with the company<br>
            • Nobody planned it, but it keeps happening<br>
            • $52 billion per year keeps going missing
        </div>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h2>Why "Theft" If No One Meant It?</h2>

        <p>Because the money is still gone.</p>

        <p>If you work full-time and can't afford rent, it doesn't matter whether your low salary was deliberate or inherited. You're still struggling.</p>

        <p>If you retire with half the superannuation of your male colleagues, it doesn't matter whether the pay gap was intentional or systemic. You're still broke at 67.</p>

        <p>If you spend 40 years being paid less for comparable work, it doesn't matter whether anyone conspired against you. You still lost $1.6 million over your lifetime.</p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            Theft is when money that should be yours ends up somewhere else.<br>
            Intent is irrelevant.<br>
            The result is what matters.
        </div>

        <p>The system was built decades ago. Nobody alive today designed it. But it keeps running. And every week, $1 billion disappears from women's collective wages into corporate budgets.</p>

        <p><strong>That's theft.</strong></p>

        <p>Not because anyone's a villain. But because the money is missing and you're the one who suffers the consequences.</p>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h2>So What Do You Do About It?</h2>

        <p>You can't dismantle an inherited system by yourself.</p>

        <p>But you can stop accepting it as inevitable.</p>

        <p>You can:</p>

        <p><strong>1. See how much has gone missing from YOUR paycheck</strong><br>
        The Wealth Theft Calculator shows you your personal number. Not the abstract $52 billion. Your specific loss based on your age, salary, and career stage.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Understand exactly how the system operates</strong><br>
        The language patterns aren't random. The pay bands aren't accidents. There are specific mechanisms that extract wealth from women's work—and once you see them, you can respond strategically.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Choose your response</strong><br>
        Negotiate. Exit. Build an alternative. The system didn't ask your permission to take your money. You don't need permission to take it back.</p>

        <div class="emphasis-box">
            <strong>Nobody's to blame. But you're still losing money.</strong><br><br>
            The question isn't "who's the villain?"<br>
            The question is: "What are you going to do about it?"

        <h1>The 50-Year Consequence</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Why Women Over 50 Are Australia's Fastest-Growing Homeless Demographic</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Blog Content -->
    <div class="blog-container">
        <article>
            <p>Every night in Australia, more than 7,300 women aged 55 and over are homeless. Most of them have never been homeless before. Many don't even recognise themselves in the word "homeless" because they're not sleeping rough on the streets.</p>

            <p>They're living in their cars. Sleeping on friends' couches. Moving between crisis accommodation. Staying in unsafe situations because they have nowhere else to go. And their numbers are growing faster than any other demographic in Australia.</p>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                Between 2011 and 2016, homelessness among women over 55 increased by 31% — making them the fastest-growing cohort of homeless Australians. By 2021, that number had climbed to 7,325 women, with an estimated 405,000 more at imminent risk.
            </div>

            <p>This isn't a crisis that appeared overnight. This is the predictable, devastating culmination of a lifetime of systematic economic disadvantage. This is what happens when women are underpaid for 50 years.</p>

            <div class="section-break"></div>

            <h2>How a Lifetime of Lower Pay Becomes Homelessness at 60</h2>

            <p>The connection between wage inequality and late-life homelessness isn't abstract. It's mathematical. When women earn less throughout their working lives, they accumulate less superannuation. When they take time out of the workforce for unpaid caring responsibilities, the gap widens further. When they're concentrated in undervalued "pink collar" roles, their earning potential is structurally capped.</p>

            <p>The result? Women retire with significantly less financial security than men. In Australia, women retire with an average of 23% less superannuation than men. For many, that difference is the difference between housing stability and homelessness.</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
                "These are women who have done everything that society has asked of them, yet they are in housing limbo because they have too much money to qualify for social housing and too little money to buy a house."
                <br>— Marie-Louise MacDonald, Retirement Living Council President
            </div>

            <p>Research shows that most older women experiencing homelessness have worked their entire lives. They've raised families, cared for aging parents, contributed to their communities. But because so much of that labour was unpaid or undervalued, they arrive at retirement age without the financial cushion men typically have.</p>

            <h3>The Perfect Storm: What Pushes Women Over the Edge</h3>

            <p>For many of these women, a single life event becomes catastrophic. Divorce after decades of marriage. The death of a partner. A health crisis that depletes savings. A rent increase they can't afford. Job loss in their late 50s when employers consider them "too old" to hire.</p>

            <p>These aren't personal failures. They're the predictable outcomes of a system that has systematically devalued women's work and underpaid them for generations.</p>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                For women aged 55-64 living in private rental accommodation who are not employed full-time, 34% are at risk of homelessness. If they're also a single parent, that risk jumps to over 65%.
            </div>

            <h2>The Hidden Nature of Older Women's Homelessness</h2>

            <p>Unlike the stereotype of homelessness — rough sleeping, visible on city streets — older women's homelessness is largely invisible. They're couch-surfing with family members who can barely accommodate them. They're living in cars parked in quiet suburban streets. They're staying in boarding houses or severely overcrowded dwellings.</p>

            <p>Many don't identify as homeless because the word carries such stigma. They blame themselves. They feel ashamed. They've internalised the message that if they'd just worked harder, saved more, made better choices, they wouldn't be in this situation.</p>

            <p>But the truth is simpler and more brutal: they were set up to fail by an economic system that never valued their contributions fairly.</p>

            <div class="section-break"></div>

            <h2>The Rental Crisis Accelerates the Problem</h2>

            <p>Australia's housing affordability crisis has turned what was already a difficult situation into an emergency. According to Anglicare's 2024 Rental Affordability Snapshot, only 0.2% of rental properties nationwide are affordable for a single person on the age pension.</p>

            <p>Let that sink in. Out of 45,115 rental properties surveyed across Australia, fewer than 100 were affordable for a single older woman on the pension.</p>

            <p>The number of older women in the private rental market doubled from 90,000 in 2006 to over 180,000 in 2016. Many describe this as a "tsunami" of older women on the verge of homelessness — and the wave hasn't crested yet.</p>

            <h3>Too Much Money for Help, Too Little for Housing</h3>

            <p>One of the cruelest aspects of this crisis is the gap between social housing eligibility and actual housing affordability. In Victoria, to qualify for social housing, an applicant must have less than $34,656 in savings and non-preserved superannuation.</p>

            <p>Many older women have just enough superannuation to disqualify them from public housing, but nowhere near enough to afford private rental or home ownership. They exist in a financial limbo where the system offers them no support, yet the market is completely out of reach.</p>

            <div class="section-break"></div>

            <h2>This Is the Cost of the Gender Pay Gap</h2>

            <p>When we talk about the gender pay gap, we often focus on current earnings. We compare salaries, discuss negotiation tactics, analyse industry disparities. All of that matters. But we rarely talk about the endpoint — the place where decades of wage discrimination ultimately leads.</p>

            <p>This is that endpoint. Women sleeping in their cars at 67. Women who worked full-time as receptionists, teachers, nurses, and administrative assistants — jobs that kept society functioning — now facing housing instability because those roles were chronically undervalued and underpaid.</p>

            <p>The gender pay gap isn't just about fairness in the present moment. It's about whether women can survive with dignity in their older years. Right now, for hundreds of thousands of Australian women, the answer is no.</p>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                An estimated 240,000 women aged 55 or older, and another 165,000 women aged 45-54, are currently at risk of homelessness in Australia. Without policy intervention, these numbers will only grow as the population ages and lone-person households increase.
            </div>

            <h2>What This Means for Women in Their 30s, 40s, and 50s Today</h2>

            <p>If you're reading this and you're decades away from retirement, you might think this doesn't apply to you. But every woman currently earning less than her male colleagues is on a trajectory toward reduced superannuation, reduced savings, and reduced housing security in her later years.</p>

            <p>The women experiencing homelessness today didn't fail. The system failed them. And unless something changes — unless women demand fair pay now, build evidence of their value now, and take strategic action now — the next generation of older women will face the same crisis.</p>

            <p>This isn't about individual choices. It's about systemic change. But systemic change begins with individual women refusing to accept underpayment as inevitable.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>The Path Forward</h2>

            <p>The homelessness crisis among older women is solvable. It requires political will, policy change, and investment in social housing. It requires addressing the structural causes of women's economic disadvantage throughout their lives, not just offering emergency assistance when they reach crisis point.</p>

            <p>But it also requires women to recognise the stakes. Every year you accept being underpaid is a year of lost superannuation contributions. Every promotion you don't fight for is thousands of dollars you won't have when you're 60. Every time you undervalue your labour, you're making your future self more vulnerable.</p>

            <p>The women sleeping in their cars tonight deserved better. They worked hard their entire lives. They contributed immeasurably to families, communities, and the economy. They were failed by a system that never properly valued or compensated their work.</p>

            <p>You deserve better too. And unlike the generations before you, you now have the data, the tools, and the knowledge to fight back.</p>
